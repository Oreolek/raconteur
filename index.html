      Raconteur dramatically speeds up writing interactive fiction with
      <a href="http://undum.com">Undum</a>.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Undum is perhaps the most versatile system for writing hypertext
      interactive fiction. Unfortunately, it's also the hardest to use.
      Raconteur aims to change that. It's designed so that you only need
      to care about the complexity that you're going to use, when you're
      going to use it.

    You are standing in an open field west of a

    <h2>Batteries Included</h2>
    <p>
      The Raconteur scaffold comes with everything you need to get started,
      configured out of the box to use a build system, CSS preprocessor, and
      bundler. Armed with a text editor (We like
      <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime</a>), you can start writing
      your story and prose, rather than support code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scaffold is set up to automate as much work as possible. You can
      make stylesheet changes and watch them load immediately on a browser.
      It even automates bundling your game and its assets into a .zip file you
      can upload to <a href="http://itch.io">Itch.io</a>.

    <h2>Adaptive Text</h2>
    <p>
      Raconteur is built with adaptive text generation in mind. Defining
      snippets of text that vary whenever the player sees them is easy.
      Raconteur takes inspiration from Inform 7 and other IF development
      systems.
      </p>
      <p>As much as possible, it treats code that produces text and
      text interchangeably. Raconteur lets you rewrite passages to include
      dynamic text very easily, so that you can spend more time rewriting
      your prose and less time refactoring your code.

    <h2>Modular</h2>
    <p>
      Raconteur is made out of modules, each implementing its own set of
      functionality. You only need to use the ones you want.

    <h2>Programmer-friendly</h2>
    <p>
      Raconteur is built using standard web development tools, instead of a
      specialist toolchain. It's familiar for people who know front-end web
      development; and those who don't will still benefit from working
      with a robust, proven toolchain.

    <h3>npm</h3>
    <p>
      The Node package manager makes it easy to install Raconteur and its
      dependencies.

    <h3>Gulp</h3>
    <p>
      Raconteur is designed to be used with a powerful build system that
      automates bundling your game and lets you see changes as you make
      them right on the browser.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="four columns">
    <h3>Browserify</h3>
    <p>
      Raconteur is made up of independent modules &ndash; Browserify bundles
      all of those modules, along with your game, into a single file, while
      keeping the code separate and modular. You can treat Raconteur as a
      true library, the guts of which you never have to look into.
